# ecowitt.github.io

This repository is used to host my own Ecowitt html dashboard tile code, since only templates seem to work in the driver and I had no way to update the developer's repoitory the driver points to.  I updated the URL in the RF Sensor driver to use this repository.

Dashboard Icons: Hosts my many custom dashbaord icons.  By placing them here, dashboard icons can be loaded from outside the local network when loading the dashboards from the internet.
